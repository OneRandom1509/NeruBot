# NeruBot
Yet another general-purpose discord bot written in Rust using [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) discord API wrapper

## TODOs
1. Polish the verify commands with permissions and channel category handling
2. Assign a moderator to the verify command
3. Do whatever feels like it would be a cool-to-have in mind
4. Explore [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) (This is later down the road)
